Many were subjected to forced labor, and there were reports of atrocities committed against the local population.\n\nThe U.S. military retook Guam in July 1944 during Operation Forager. The battle was intense, with significant fighting resulting in considerable destruction to the island and its infrastructure. The liberation was a turning point for the Chamorro people, who had suffered greatly during the occupation.\n\nAfter the war, Guam underwent extensive reconstruction and political changes. The U.S. Navy administered the island for several years, and in 1950, the Organic Act was signed, granting American citizenship to the local Chamorro population and establishing a civilian government. This period marked the beginning of a new chapter for Guam as it transitioned from military control to a more civilian-oriented governance structure. \n\nThe impacts of the war, including the loss of life, displacement, and cultural changes, are still deeply felt in Guam today, and the memories of those experiences continue to shape the identity of the Chamorro people.",

It typically involves marinating a main ingredient—usually chicken, beef, deer, or seafood—in a pickling marinade made of lemon or lime juice, fresh coconut, green onions, salt, and spicy hot peppers. This process is somewhat similar to ceviche, as the marinade effectively \"cooks\" the meat. Kelaguen can be served as a side dish or as a main course, making it a versatile part of Chamorro cuisine. \n\nIf you're interested in trying to make it, there are many recipes available that can guide you through the process!
