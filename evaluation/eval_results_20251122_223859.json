Kåo?** (Are we going together? Yes/No?)\n   - **Bai hu chule' i kafe? Kåo?** (Will I drink the coffee?

For example:\n\n- The verb \"såga\" (to stay) becomes \"nasåga\" (stayed).\n- The verb \"fåhan\" (to buy) becomes \"nafåhan\" (bought).\n\nFor verbs that do not use the \"man-\" prefix, you typically just use the root form of the verb without any prefix. \n\nWhen forming past tense statements, the structure might look something like this: \"Hu nasåga\" means \"I stayed.\"\n\nIt's also helpful to practice with flashcards or exercises that combine past tense with other tenses to reinforce your understanding of when to use these forms.

They developed a unique culture characterized by intricate navigation skills, advanced agriculture, and distinctive social structures. Chamorro society was traditionally matrilineal, with family ties traced through the mother's line.\n\nThe arrival of Europeans in the 16th century marked a significant turning point. The Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan was the first European to reach the Marianas in 1521, leading to Spanish colonization in 1565. This period had profound effects on Chamorro society, including the introduction of Christianity, changes in social structures, and significant population decline due to diseases brought by Europeans.\n\nDuring World War II, the Chamorro people experienced immense hardships. Guam was occupied by Japanese forces from 1941 until 1944, leading to severe oppression and suffering. After the war, Guam became a U.S. territory, and the Chamorro people faced new social and political challenges.\n\nIn recent decades, there has been a resurgence of interest in Chamorro culture and language, with efforts to preserve and revitalize traditions, languages, and practices. Today, the Chamorro community continues to celebrate its heritage through festivals, storytelling, and educational programs.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more about Chamorro heritage, you might want to check out resources on Chamorro legends and cultural practices, which highlight the unique traditions that have been passed down through generations.",

      "actual": "During World War II, Guam faced significant hardships and devastation. The island was occupied by Japanese forces starting in December 1941, shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Chamorro people suffered under harsh conditions during this occupation, which lasted until the U.S. military retook the island in July 1944.\n\nThe occupation was marked by severe restrictions and brutal treatment of the local population. Many Chamorros were displaced from their homes, and some were forced into labor for the Japanese military. The major villages of Sumai and Hagåtña were heavily bombed during the American invasion, which left the island in ruins.\n\nThe U.S. military liberation of Guam brought an influx of over 200,000 American military personnel to the island, which significantly changed its demographics and social structure. After the war, the reconstruction efforts began, but many Chamorros had lost their land and homes, and issues of land compensation became a major concern.\n\nThe aftermath of the war also led to political changes, with Guam becoming an unincorporated territory of the United States. The Organic Act was signed in 1950, establishing the government of Guam and granting American citizenship to the Chamorro people. This period marked a significant turning point in Guam's history, with lasting impacts on its culture, governance, and identity.",

This marination process is similar to ceviche, where the marinade helps to \"cook\" the meat, especially when using raw seafood. Kelaguen can be served as a side dish or as a main course.
