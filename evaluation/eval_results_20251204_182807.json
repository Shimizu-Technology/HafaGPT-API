For example, \"Ginen yu' Guåhan.\" (I am from Guam).\n\nPutting it all together, your introduction could go like this:\n\"Håfa Adai! Yu'os siña håfa, si Maria.

It's about the physical space that provides shelter from direct sunlight.\n\n- **Seddía**, on the other hand, can also mean shadow in a more literal sense, such as the shadow cast by an object or a person. It can be used when describing the actual silhouette or shape formed by something blocking the light.\n\nIn everyday conversation, these words might be used interchangeably, but their nuances can be important depending on the context of the conversation.

For example, if you take the verb \"hånao\" (to go), adding the \"man-\" prefix would change it to \"manhånao,\" meaning \"they are going\" or \"we are going,\" depending on the context.\n\nIt's similar to how in English, we might use \"they\" instead of \"he\" or \"she\" to denote that more than one person is involved. This prefix is quite common in Chamorro and helps convey the number of subjects performing the verb's action. Let me know if you have more questions about Chamorro grammar!",
