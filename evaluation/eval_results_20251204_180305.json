For example:\n   - \"Håfa bidå-mo?\" means \"What is your name?\" (Literally: \"What your name?\")\n   - \"Håyi este?\" means \"Who is this?\"\n\n3. **Intonation**: Sometimes, a question can be formed simply by changing the intonation of a statement, especially in yes-no questions.\n   - \"Håfa tatatmanu hao?\" means \"How are you?\" [Source: chamorro_english_dictionary_TOD]\n\n4. **Particles**: Chamorro also uses certain particles to indicate questions. For instance, \"kao\" can be used to start a yes-no question:\n   - \"Kao para un hånao?\" means \"Are you going?\"\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect.

The small American garrison on the island was unable to withstand the invasion, and Guam fell into Japanese hands on December 10, 1941.\n\n2. **Occupation Hardships**: During the Japanese occupation, the Chamorro people faced harsh conditions, including forced labor, cultural suppression, and brutal treatment. The occupiers implemented policies that aimed to assimilate the local population into Japanese culture.\n\n3. **Liberation**: The liberation of Guam began on July 21, 1944, when American forces launched a major amphibious assault known as the Battle of Guam. This operation was part of the larger effort in the Pacific to reclaim territories occupied by Japan. The battle was intense and resulted in significant casualties on both sides.\n\n4. **Post-Liberation**: After the successful liberation, Guam became an important American military base, which it remains today.

Say your name: \"I na’ån-hu si [Your Name].\" This means \"My name is [Your Name].\" For example, if your name is Maria, you would say \"I na’ån-hu si Maria.\"\n\n3.
