The Chamorro people are the indigenous inhabitants of these islands, and their history dates back over 3,500 years. Here are some key aspects of Chamorro history:\n\n1. **Pre-Colonial Era**: The Chamorros are believed to have arrived in the Mariana Islands from Southeast Asia. They developed a unique culture characterized by their social organization, agricultural practices, and skilled craftsmanship, including the construction of latte stones, which served as foundation pillars for their homes.\n\n2. **Spanish Colonization**: In 1565, Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi arrived in Guam, marking the beginning of over 300 years of Spanish colonization. The Spanish introduced Christianity, which significantly impacted Chamorro culture and traditions. During this time, many Chamorros faced challenges, including forced labor and diseases introduced by Europeans.\n\n3. **American Period**: After the Spanish-American War in 1898, Guam was ceded to the United States. This marked a new chapter in Chamorro history, characterized by American influence in governance, education, and military presence. The Chamorro people's fight for self-determination and cultural preservation continued during this period.\n\n4. **World War II Impact**: Guam was occupied by Japanese forces during World War II from 1941 until 1944. The war had devastating effects on the Chamorro population, including loss of life and displacement. Following the liberation of Guam by American forces in 1944, many Chamorros began to reclaim their culture and identity.\n\n5. **Cultural Revitalization**: In the latter half of the 20th century, there was a resurgence of interest in Chamorro culture, language, and traditions. Efforts to preserve and promote Chamorro identity have included language revitalization programs, cultural festivals, and educational initiatives.\n\n6. **Political Status**: Guam remains an unincorporated territory of the United States. The Chamorro people continue to advocate for greater political representation and self-determination, seeking to define their identity and future.\n\nThe history of the Chamorro people is a testament to their resilience and adaptability, reflecting a blend of indigenous practices and influences from various cultures over centuries.

The island's infrastructure was heavily damaged due to military actions, including bombings and ground battles.\n\nOn July 21, 1944, American troops landed on Guam and engaged in intense fighting to retake the island.

After the war, Guam faced the challenge of reconstruction and healing, as many structures were destroyed, and the population had to deal with the lasting effects of the conflict.\n\nThe post-war period also marked a change in Guam's political landscape, as it became an unincorporated territory of the United States.

It's often made by marinating a main ingredient, which could be chicken, beef, deer, or seafood, in a pickling marinade that includes lemon or lime juice, fresh coconut, green onions, salt, and spicy hot peppers. This method of cooking allows the marinade to essentially \"cook\" the meat, similar to how ceviche is prepared. Kelaguen can be served as a side dish or as a main course, making it a versatile and flavorful part of Chamorro cuisine. [Sources: Annie's Chamorro Kitchen, Wikipedia, Uncle Jerry's Kitchen]",
