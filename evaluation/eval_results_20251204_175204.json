For example:\n   - **Håfa tatatmanu hao?** (How are you?)\n   - **Amånu hao sumåsaga?** (Where do you live?)\n\n3. **Yes/No Questions**: These questions can be formed by changing the intonation at the end of the sentence, similar to English. For instance:\n   - **Un chule' i lepblu?** (Did you take the book?)\n\n4. **Using \"Kao\"**: Sometimes, \"kao\" is used at the beginning of a yes/no question to indicate that it is a question:\n   - **Kao un tungo' håyi gue'?** (Do you know who he/she is?)\n\nThese are some basics to get you started with forming questions in Chamorro.
