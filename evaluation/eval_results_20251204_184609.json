Here are some common question words:\n   - **Håfa** - What\n   - **Håyi** - Who\n   - **Ngai'an** - When\n   - **Amånu** - Where\n   - **Sa' håfa** - Why\n\n2. **Question Structure**: The structure of questions can vary, but typically the question word comes at the beginning of the sentence. For example:\n   - **Håfa tatatmanu hao?** - How are you? (Note: \"tatatmanu\" is a greeting word used in questions, as per Reference 3.)\n\n3. **Yes/No Questions**: These can be formed by changing the intonation of a statement, much like in English. There isn't a direct equivalent to adding \"do\" or \"does\" as in English questions; context and intonation play a significant role.\n\n4. **Question Markers**: In spoken Chamorro, the tone of voice typically indicates a question. In written Chamorro, a question mark is used at the end of the sentence.\n\nRemember, practice and listening to native speakers can help you get a feel for the natural flow of questions in Chamorro.

      "actual": "In Chamorro, the prefix \"man-\" is often used to indicate plurality, particularly in verbs and nouns. When added to a verb, it can signify that the action is being performed by multiple subjects. For example, \"baila\" means \"to dance,\" and \"manbaila\" means \"they dance\" or \"they are dancing,\" indicating more than one person is involved in the dancing. This prefix is a useful way to convey that an action is being carried out collectively. It's similar to adding \"they\" or \"we\" in English to show that the action involves multiple people. \n\nFeel free to ask if you have more questions about Chamorro grammar or usage!",
