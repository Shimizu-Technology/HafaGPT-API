The intonation rises at the end to indicate a question.\n\n3. **Using \"Kao\"**: The word \"kao\" is often used to form yes-no questions. It is placed at the beginning of the sentence.\n   - **Kao para un hånao?** - Are you going?\n\n4. **Inversion**: Occasionally, the subject and verb can be inverted to form a question, though this is less common.\n\nIt's fascinating how Chamorro incorporates both unique elements and some familiar structures when forming questions.
