## Chamorro Alphabet

The modern Chamorro alphabet has **24 letters**. Some key differences from English:

| Letter | IPA | Pronunciation Guide | Example |
|--------|-----|---------------------|---------|
| **a** | /æ/ | like "a" in "cat" | akague = ah-KAH-geh |
| **å** | /ɑ/ | like "aw" in "saw" | håfa = HAW-fah |
| **b** | /b/ | like English "b" | babui = bah-BOO-ee |
| **ch** | /ts/ | like "ts" in "bits" | chocho = TSO-tso |
| **d** | /d/ | like English "d" | dikike' = dee-KEE-keh |
| **e** | /ɛ/ | like "e" in "pet" | betde = BEHT-deh |
| **f** | /f/ | like English "f" | familia = fah-MEE-lee-ah |
| **g** | /g/ | like English "g" in "go" | guma' = GOO-mah |
| **h** | /h/ | like English "h" | haggan = HAHG-gahn |
| **i** | /i/ | like "ee" in "see" | isa = EE-sah |
| **k** | /k/ | like English "k" | katu = KAH-too |
| **l** | /l/ | like English "l" | lahi = LAH-hee |
| **m** | /m/ | like English "m" | mata = MAH-tah |

## Critical Pronunciation Rules

### 1. Y = /dz/ (like "d" + "z" together)
This is the **most commonly confused sound**. The letter "y" in Chamorro is NOT pronounced like English "y". It's pronounced like "dz" - a quick "d" followed by "z" sound (similar to the end of "adds" or "beds").

| Wrong ❌ | Correct ✅ |
|---------|-----------|
| hayi = "HIGH" | hayi = "HA-dzee" |
| yu' = "yoo" | yu' = "dzoo" |
| guaiya = "gwah-EE-yah" | guaiya = "gwah-EE-dzah" |
| ayuyu = "ah-YOO-yoo" | ayuyu = "ah-DZOO-dzoo" |
| yan = "yahn" | yan = "dzahn" |
| taya' = "TAH-yah" | taya' = "TAH-dzah" |

**Source:** Revised Chamorro Dictionary: "y: the twenty-fourth letter of the alphabet, pronounced /dz/ and named ye"

### 2. CH = /ts/ (like "ts")
The Chamorro "ch" is NOT like English "ch" in "church".

| Wrong ❌ | Correct ✅ |
|---------|-----------|
| chocho = "CHOH-choh" | chocho = "TSO-tso" |
| pachot = "pah-CHOHT" | pachot = "pah-TSOHT" |

**Source:** Revised Chamorro Dictionary: "ch: the fifth letter of the Chamorro alphabet, pronounced /ts/"

### 3. Å = /ɑ/ (like "aw")
The ringed "å" has a distinct sound from regular "a".

| Letter | Sound | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| a | /æ/ (cat) | akague |
| å | /ɑ/ (saw) | håfa, på'go |

### 4. NG = /ŋ/ (single sound)
"NG" is one letter representing one sound, like the "ng" in "sing" (not "n" + "g").

### 5. Glottal Stop (')
The apostrophe represents a brief pause, like the stop in "uh-oh".

| Word | Pronunciation |
|------|---------------|
| guma' | GOO-mah (with stop) |
| ma'åse' | mah-AW-seh |

### 6. Ñ = /ɲ/ (like Spanish "ny")
The "ñ" is pronounced like in Spanish "cañón" or English "canyon".

| Word | Pronunciation |
|------|---------------|
| siña | SEEN-nyah |
| mañana | mah-NYAH-nah |

## Pronunciation Symbols Used in Flashcards
