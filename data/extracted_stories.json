Not once was there ever a disaster at sea at this time, because there was always respect, regardless of the place. Whether it was sea or land, if we were visiting a place, we must give food or ask for forgiveness, because we know that there are those who should have a place, those who were before us. These are the things that are taught to us by our elders. And it’s absolutely true, not once was there an accident at sea or someone who was made sick in the jungle."
